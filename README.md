# Profile Page

This is a beginner project studying the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality in the form of a mock profile page. 

<br>

The main features of this page are that clicking the `edit profile` link will change the name of the main profile to my own name, as well as functionality in the confirm/reject boxes for incoming connection requests. In clicking either icon, the connection request goes away, and the request number decreases by one. In clicking the confirm icon, the number of connections in the box below increases by one as well.
